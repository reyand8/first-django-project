# Python Django Project Blog

It's my first Django project the idea of which was to realise the new material and a deeper studying of already acquired skills. 
This project gave me the understanding of my weaknesses which I will work at in the future. 
The web-blog was created for users who can add their reviews of books and films. They must sign up or log in to add their reviews. 
Categories can be added only by admin in Django Admin. In the project, I used pytest and unittest to understand how to use their basic 
differences and features.

Here you can see some commands that can be useful to you:

* Create docker image
```
$ docker build -t <your image name> . 
```

* Build or rebuild services
```
$ docker-compose build 
```

* Create and start containers 
```
$ docker-compose up
```

* Stop and remove containers, networks
```
$ docker-compose down
```

* Create superuser
```
$ docker-compose run app python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
