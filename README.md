# Django Project Blog

It's my first Django project the idea of which was to realise the new material and a deeper studying of already acquired skills. 
This project gave me the understanding of my weaknesses which I will work at in the future. 
The web-blog was created for users who can add their reviews of books and films. They must sign up or log in to add their reviews. 
Categories can be added only by admin in Django Admin. In the project, I used pytest and unittest to understand how to use their basic 
differences and features.
DOCKER 
It was my first Docker setup. It was quite complicated but these errors allowed me to understand some aspects in a more datailed way.
